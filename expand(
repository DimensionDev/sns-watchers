# Watchers for SNS network which Maskbook supports

## How a watcher works?

Twitter, for example, is a `SPA`, we take a snapshot of the page and JS
resources of the page everyday, and store the snapshots in this git repo, once
twitter get updated, we can get change notification of the changing from an
auto-created pull-request by Github Action in this repo.

Twitter ships minified code, to make differences of changes more obvious, we
format them with prettier during the snapshot creating.
